# Glow Grid Generator

Given the rgb value of the grid and the original texture, generate an Optifine-based glow grid.

## How to use

Note: python 3.11 and pdm must be installed first.
If this is your first time using it, run the `pdm sync` command first.

1. Run `run.bat`
2. Modify `data/color_map.json`, the key is the path of the map, and the value is the RGB converted to decimal (no need to modify it if the texture entered is already with a grid)
3. Run `run.bat` again
